Running Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Reinforcement Learning in CARLA

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an advanced off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed for continuous action spaces. It is particularly suited for tasks requiring precise control, such as autonomous vehicle navigation in simulated environments like CARLA. SAC optimizes a stochastic policy and incorporates an entropy term into its objective to encourage exploration, making it robust to sparse reward settings.

In the context of CARLA, SAC can be used to train autonomous agents to perform tasks such as lane-keeping, obstacle avoidance, and navigation through dynamic traffic scenarios. The CARLA simulator provides a realistic environment with configurable weather, traffic density, and complex road networks, enabling the development and testing of RL-based driving policies.

Using SAC in CARLA involves creating a gym-compatible environment that interfaces with the simulator. The agent interacts with the environment, learning optimal driving behaviors through a reward function tailored to specific objectives, such as minimizing collisions or staying within lanes. By leveraging SAC's ability to handle high-dimensional continuous action spaces, autonomous driving models can achieve robust performance in varied and challenging scenarios.
